The famous category of IoT application is environment monitoring and agriculture is belong to it,

In an IoT system of agriculture, the environment temperature, humidity, brightness, soil condition, air quality and rain density data are collected by the relevant sensors, and then upload to server through an IoT controller for monitor and analysis purpose. The <span><b>Internet Control System</b></span> usually has been designed an algorithm for anlayze the environment situations and also provide the solution to handle farm activities.

For a high level industry, all activities are doned by intelligent machine like robots and drones.

1. Turn on <span><b>watering</b></span> machine while rain density is low

2. Turn on <span><b>LED</b></span> when sun light is not sufficient (Or let the plant doing photosynthesis 24 hours)

3. Activate the drone to <span><b>fertilize</b></span> the crops if soil's nutrients does not meet condition

4. Activate the robot to <span><b>haverst</b></span> the crops after they have growth enough height
