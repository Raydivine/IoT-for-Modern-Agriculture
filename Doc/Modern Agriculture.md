The famous category of IoT application is environment monitoring, agriculture with IoT is belong this category,
usually we would like to known the basic environment data like temperature, humidity or air quality, and then famers would also like to known soil (pH value or moisture), sun light (brightness) and rain (density). 
</article>

By collecting the real time environment data to server,  agricultre experts can design and suggest an automative, which perform action while the environment situationshave changed.

<h3>Exmple like</h3>

1. Turn on watering machine while humidity is low

<hr/>
2. Turn on LED when sun light is not sufficient (Or some industry wanted crops to do photosynthesis at night too)

3. Active drone to do fertilization if the pH value of soil doesn't meet the condition

4. Let the robots go haverst your crops after they growth

With IoT technology, modern agriculture is performing efficieny and without permanent human force.

>The briefing I give above is based on real industry purpose. For my firmware only monitor the data and upload to server.
