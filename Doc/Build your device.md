<h3><ins>Why is the circuit like this?</ins></h3>
Nodemcu has only one [ADC](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp8266-thing-hookup-guide/using-the-arduino-addon) pin which can read the voltage value, for non ADC pins can only read voltage high and low.
In order to read the value of brightness and water level, this 2 sensor has to share the ADC pin and [power control](http://www.instructables.com/id/ESP8266-with-Multiple-Analog-Sensors/) by manually supply voltage from D5 and D1 , when one sensor is on another should be off. (Transistor switch is not comfortable use in this case due to there is 0.7 bias voltage)
And then, this ADC pin can only read voltage range from 0V to 1V, so you have to scale down the sensor's output to 1V by using voltage divider circuit.

<h3><ins>Procedure</ins></h3>
1. Prepare a micro-usb charger or cabel for supply power to your NodeMCU.
2. Connect 3V3 pin or Vin pin to your VCC, and GND pin to ground.
3. Connect DHT11's data pin to D7, GND for ground and VCC for VCC.
4. Connect water level sensour '+'pin to D5, '-'pin to ground, 's' pin to 100立 -> 80立 -> ground.
5. Connect photoresistor to D1 and the opposite to 10k ohms -> ground , from the between, connect to 2k立-> 1k立 -> ground.
6. Connect RSV pin to the the middle of resistors as diagram shown above.

<h3><ins>Take note</ins></h3> 
a. [Power on NodeMCU](http://henrysbench.capnfatz.com/henrys-bench/arduino-projects-tips-and-more/powering-the-esp-12e-nodemcu-development-board/)                                                                                
As long the as USB power is connected, NodeMCU can supply 3V output voltage from 3V3 pin, or 5V voltage from Vin pin. To make our life simple, just power the device with micro usb charger, then choose 3v3 pin or Vin pin as your Vdd.

b. [ADC pin issue](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/blob/master/docs/en/modules/adc.md)                                      
In my case, analogRead(A0) understand the RSV pin as A0.I am not sure how does this happen, you may try running analogRead(A0) then apply voltage to A0 pin and RSV pins to find the correct pin refer to.     

c. [Prevent using D3,D4,D8 pins](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/doc/boards.md#boot-messages-and-modes)                   
This 3 pins are refer to gpio 0,2,15 which are the setting of nodeMCU boot mode, it is possible that your arduino skectch failed to boot  if any of those pins connected.
