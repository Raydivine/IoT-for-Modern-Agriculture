ESPressif firmware is working nice to me 
AI thinker firmware is not stable, which mention by this tutorial, for my experience too 

I still provide the two developers firmware
Please watch this video if you would like to use AI Thinker firmware

For the ESPressift firmware, the version I that provide is 2.0.0
it is working nice but I would suggest download the lastest version from this forum

http://bbs.espressif.com/viewforum.php?f=46  (The forum post are english and chinese together, dont be mess up, attachement file always at the end of post)
look for lastest post of [SDK Release] to download the complete SDK + AT firmware

     
Download the lastest Tool

Look under "Flash Download Tools", use another version if failed on flashing state
