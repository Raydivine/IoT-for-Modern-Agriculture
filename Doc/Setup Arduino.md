<h3>Setup Arduino</h3>

1. Download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) , if you would like use portable version, please download      from "Window Zip File"<br/>
   The installer will request you to install CP210X driver as well, please accept it for connect to NodeMCU.
<hr/>
2. Open Arduino IDE,nclick on File->Preference , copy the URL below into "Addition Board Manager URL"<br/>
   http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json<br/>
   This URL link to resouces of  NodeMCU's Arduino Framework, the framework has contain the low end implementaion like WiFi function. 
 <hr/>
3. Go to Tool->Board->Board Manager, install the NodeMCU's (esp8266) Arduino Framework.(Please intall lasted version)

   <i>Arduino library contain a lot of resources, so you don't have to implement them as long they are found in library.</i>
