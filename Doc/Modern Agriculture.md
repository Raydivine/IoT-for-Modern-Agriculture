The famous category of IoT application is environment monitoring and agriculture is belong to it,

For an IoT of agriculture system, the environment temperature, humidity, brightness, soil condition, air quality and rain density data are collected by the relevant sensors, and then uploaded to server through an IoT controller for monitor and analysis purpose. The <span><b>Internet Control System</b></span> usually has been designed an algorithm for anlayze the environment situations and  provide the solution to handle farm activities.

For  high level industry, all activities are done by intelligent machine like robots and drones.

<h3><ins>For the examples</ins></h3>

1. Turn on <span><b>watering</b></span> machine while rain density is low

2. Turn on <span><b>LED</b></span> when sun light is not sufficient (Or let the plant doing photosynthesis 24 hours)

3. Activate the drone to <span><b>fertilize</b></span> the crops if soil's nutrients does not meet condition

4. Activate the robot to <span><b>haverst</b></span> the crops after they have growth enough height

By appllying IoT technology and advanced industrial machine, modern agriculture is performing in <span><b>high efficiency, automotive</b></span> and <span><b>green way</b></span>.
